Cogito, ergo sum. I think, therefore I am. This is the first concept you are introduced to in any course on the history of modern philosophy. It is, for all intents and purposes, the "Hello World!" of the philosophical discourse. When Descartes sat down for his meditations and came to that famous conclusion, "I think; therefore I am," he was taking the first step in a very long process of self discovery that would captivate humanity for centuries to come. This process was continued by computing pioneers like Zeiss and Turing, but having studied philosophy before pivoting to software engineering, the words of philosophers always ring a little clearer with me.

My first introduction to programing languages came in a philosophical discourse while studying formal logic in college. In my third semester, I was enrolled in a graduate level set theory course. Learning about the logic that philosophers and mathematicians like Bertrand Russell used to literally define the existence of numbers was fascinating to me. Simply the ability to transpose a complex and interrelated world into a logical syntax privy to the functions and methods of a calculus based language was astonishing to me. Later in the course, my professor told me that not only were the methods and functions we were implementing logically identical to those within the famous programming language 'C', but even the syntax was virtually identical.

This was a revolutionary moment in my education. I had always been fascinated by computers and their seemingly mystical qualities; I still remember installing Windows 98 on my home computer at 4 years old, but the foreignness of a PC's inner mechanics always made the field seem overly intimidating to me. That changed when I realized how much everything in a computer fundamentally relies on the logic I had been studying for over a year. As a result, when I later changed schools, I began pursuing computer science full time. The ability to be wonderfully creative whilst maintaining a level of cold mathematical precision was intoxicating to me. I became enthralled with the history of computers and how brilliant minds had addressed complex problems with elegant solutions. 

I eventually went on to write my senior thesis on Artificial Intelligence, with an emphasis on how the computing and philosophical discourses had used formal logic to address similar concepts and problems. It was truly an effort to blend the seemingly disparate studies that had dominated my education. As a result of my educational trajectory, I think I'll always have a unique perspective on programming and software. I believe that we aren't all that different from the computers we program, for in the end, it is our ability to not only think but reach out and greet the world that makes us what we are.
